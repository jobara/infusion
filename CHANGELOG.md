* Test Infrastructure
  * jqUnit.test supports async tests with promises

### Changed

    * infusion-framework.js

    Infusion components that use the Renderer.

For more details see: [Deprecated in 3.0]

### Removed

* For the Reorderer component, the `stylisticOffset` selector has been removed
* `fluid.tabs` component has been removed

  supporting native [HTML5 range inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range).

For more details see: [API Changes from 2.0 to 3.0]

### Fixed

* [FLUID-4000](https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-4000): "Larger" inputs doesn't change input size
* [FLUID-6137](https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6137): Cannot use distributeOptions to distribute an option
  when the source points at a value of 0
* [FLUID-6169](https://issues.fluidproject.org/browse/FLUID-6169): `fluid.prefs.tempStore` acts as a

## [2.0.0] - 2016-12-08

### Added

* Constraint-based priorities, supported by `listeners`, `modelListeners`, `modelRelay`, `distributeOptions`,
  `contextAwareness`, and `components`. This allows the specific order of those items to be configured.
  (See: [Priorities](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/Priorities.html))
* Context Awareness - and things it relies on:
  * Global Instantiator
    * Every Infusion component, regardless of how it is instantiated, ends up in a single-rooted tree of components
    * This enables use of modern IoC features such as model relay and declarative event binding
    * Enables use of the root distributeOptions context "/"
    * Useful debugging tip: Watch fluid.globalInstantiator in your JS debugging tools to see the structure of your
      application and its tree.
* `fluid.notImplemented` function for implementing abstract grades
* [Lazy loading for UI Options](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/UserInterfaceOptionsAPI.html#lazyload)
  and instructions for how to use the Preferences Framework with a [zero initial load time](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-prefsFrameworkMinimalFootprint/MinimalFootprint.html).
  * This should assist in improving performance when using the Preferences Framework, particularly for resource
    intensive sites and applications
* Much faster invokers and boiled listeners (c. 60x faster)
* Support for using Infusion with npm for both Node.js and web-based projects.
  * Provides a variety of prebuilt versions of Infusion in the module's dist directory.
* Source Maps are generated for the concatenated JavaScript files
* View oriented IoC debugging tools
  * Including FluidViewDebugging.js on the page of any Infusion application gives you access to the _IoC View Inspector_
  . Click on the small cogwheel icon at the bottom right of the page to open a panel which shows the details of the view
  components and their grades, that are attached to DOM nodes in the browser pane. This interface works similarly to the
  _DOM Inspector_ familiar from modern web browsers, but is an experimental implementation with an engineer-level UI.

### Changed

* Consolidated component grades
* Order of merging component grades has reversed - grades at the right-hand end of the gradeNames list now take priority
  over those at the left
* Progressive Enhancement becomes Context Awareness
* `fluid.event.makeEventFirer` has been moved to `fluid.makeEventFirer`
* Model sharing happens without additional configuring of the `changeApplier`
* `that.model` should not be used directly
* Preferences Framework
  * Panels
    * Message bundle keys
    * Selectors
    * Styles
  * Enactors
    * Renamed "fluid.prefs.enactors" to "fluid.prefs.enactor"
  * Schema
    * `%prefix` replaced by `%templatePrefix` and `%messagePrefix`
  * Preference Editor
    * Preference model values now stored under a `preferences` model path

For more details see: [API Changes from 1.5 to 2.0]

### Deprecated

* `fluid.progress`
* jQuery UI Slider version of `fluid.textfieldSlider`
* The no JavaScript version of `fluid.uploader`

For more details see: [Deprecated in 2.0]

### Removed

* Demands blocks
* Component lifecycle events `preInit`, `postInit` and `finalInit`
* Component events `onAttach` and `onClear`
* Several Preferences Framework enactor styles
* Several Preferences Framework preference editor styles and selectors
